# DuckyEmulator
A simple java program that reads and executes ducky scripts (from the popular hak5 rubber ducky)

This program reads in rubber ducky scripts and executes them, currently only working for qwerty keyboards on windows, set to 
irish language. I dont have access to macs to get them compatible nor time to add linux, as for other keyboard layouts and 
languages, I need to work on that. More details on this project can be found here: https://hackaday.io/project/1153-hak5-usb-rubberducky-emulator
