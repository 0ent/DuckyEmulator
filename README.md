# DuckyEmulator
A simple java program that reads and executes ducky scripts (from the popular hak5 rubber ducky)

This program reads in rubber ducky scripts and executes them, currently only working for qwerty keyboards on windows, set to 
irish language. I dont have access to macs to get them compatible nor time to add linux, as for other keyboard layouts and 
languages, I need to work on that. More details on this project can be found here: https://hackaday.io/project/1153-hak5-usb-rubberducky-emulator


UPDATE / NOTICE 2018

I havent been working on this project in years due to college and other projects, so putting this notice here, anyone able to work on this or improve it, input is welcome, some of the things I'd intended to develop where being able to write and save scripts directly from the program and to add multiple keyboard profiles allowing the user to set which to use as well as maybe different languages. I've noticed the robot class does have its quirks with those. Contributions and imrovements are welcome anyways as well as improving this program to work properly on linux and mac.
